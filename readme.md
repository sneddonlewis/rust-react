# My Web App

Generate TypeScript type definitions
Need to now tune this command. Run it from server dir
```
tsync -i ./src -o ../client/src/types.d.ts
```
## TODOs

- Move gitignores to repo level
- Remove old client (inside server)
- connect new client to server
- adjust `tsync` command call

## Roadmap

This is a play about/learning repo so some things to add:
- CRUD with diesel and SQLite then PostgreSQL
- Frontend does CRUD stuff
- Auth
- TLS
- Production Ready
- Little bit biz logic
- Tests
- CI
